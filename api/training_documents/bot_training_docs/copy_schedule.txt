How do I copy a schedule?
Go to ShiftPlanning module from the top-panel > Go to the timeline you want the schedule to get copied to > Click the drop-down icon > Select Copy Schedule tab > Select the dates you want to copy the schedule using From tab > Select the Options, as per your requirements > Click Copy Shifts tab to copy the schedule from the selected timeline to the current calendar view.
 


 
For Example:
Step 1: I want the schedule to get copied to 11/19/2019 - 11/25/2019 so I have moved to that timeline.
 
Step 2: I want the schedule to get copied from 11/5/2019 to 11/11/2019 to the current timeline; hence, I have added these dates next to From tab.
 
Step 3: I wish to copy shift times only; therefore, I have selected that option.
 
Step 4: Lastly, I have clicked the Copy Schedule tab to copy the schedule.

That's it, the schedule will be copied to the current timeline!
 



Notes:
 
You can either copy shift time only or copy shift times and employee assignments.
You may also check the box next to clear schedule before copying and it will remove the added schedule from the timeline you want the schedule to get copied at.
The past schedule can also be used as a template to copy shifts into a future date which then can be adjusted as required.
